title: Code Patterns Overview
---

To complement the IBM Cloud for Garage Development Tools this project provides
a set of **Code Patterns**. These have been designed to give a production ready
entry point for Cloud-Native development. While the use of the **Code Patterns
** is not required to be able
to use the development tools, their use is **highly recommended**.

There are a small number of **Code Pattern** git repositories that provide
 support for
 different
 architecture layers of your Cloud-Native
solution these includes:

- User Interfaces
- Backend for Frontends
- Microservices

You can pick the **Code Pattern** that best meets your requirements and it will
 seamlessly integrate
with the installed development tools.

You can work with more [Code Patterns](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/) from
  [developer.ibm.com](https://developer.ibm.com/).
These patterns can be "enabled" using the `Bring your own code` approach on
[Code Patterns Docs](/resources/codepatterns-gitrepos).
Even though they are "enabled" they are not optimised for production usage and do not include a number of key IBM Garage best practices.
They are fully open source and they can be enhanced overtime.

You can also work with the **Code Patterns** provided from the IBM Cloud
 [IBM Cloud Code Patterns](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/starter-kits) for
  the server side patterns you can "enabled" these using the `Bring your own
   code` approach on [Code Patterns Docs](/resources/codepatterns-gitrepos)

There is more information below on what is included in the **Code Patterns**.

## Why another Code Pattern

As teams have built out production solutions using IBM Kubernetes Services and RedHat OpenShift
on the IBM Cloud it has became clear that starting with a `hello-world
` style code pattern slows down an agile team.

In cases where you are learning the basic principles of Cloud-Native development with a specific language it does help
to start with the basic principles of `hello-world` but when you are building production code to be used by real users
it takes a lot of effort to industrialize this code ready for production.

The objective of these *Code Patterns* is to kick off a project quickly so
 they can reach maximum development
velocity in the least amount of time. To not contain any business logic and to have a set of proven opinionated
frameworks that are commonly used in the industry this can include `Express`, `React` and testing frameworks.

Why Code Patterns ? As the approach to Cloud-Native microservice development has evolved
a number of language frameworks have come into play, runtime configuration technologies and best practices
to improve quality and robustness. It becomes very time consuming to create, manage and maintain these elements.

If we look at a typical Cloud-Native app, they require a number of supporting files, similar to the ones
found in the outer ring of this diagram. They take time to create and are only often needed for the initial
seed of the project. Its also never clear where the documentation is for these elements and how they are work together.

Some typical examples :

- Dockerfile
- Helm chart
- CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration), [Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton), etc.)
- TDD Frameworks
- Code Analysis
- Monitoring / Logging Support
- Cloud Service bindings and credentials
- User Case logic UI, BFF, Microservice

The Code Patterns provide a key number of these supporting files and meta data
 and are tested on every code change to make sure they work with IBM
  Kubernetes and IBM Red Hat OpenShift managed clusters environments.

The purpose of the Code Pattern is to provide the scaffold code for the elements outside of your working
use case business logic. This will then allow a developer to get started a
 lot quicker and allow you to push code regularly into your CI environment.

## What constitutes a good code pattern

If you want to contribute a **Code Pattern** have a look at the examples that are provided. They all have most of the
features listed below. They must be UBI ([Universal Base Image](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image)) based
so they can run in Red Hat OpenShift as well as Kubernetes. They must have a `Dockerfile` that uses that UBI.
To make them work with continuous integration, you can provide a Jenkins or Tekton pipeline.

Make sure there is a good use case that is repeatable in your solution architecture. Make sure the code is documented and includes a `README.md'. There is good code coverage for tests and you have integrated SonarQube code scanning on the build process.
Finally them put in open source so other developers can enhance, improve or consume.
