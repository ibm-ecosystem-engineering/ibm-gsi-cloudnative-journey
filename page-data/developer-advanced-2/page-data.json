Developer intermediate focuses on being able to use the environment well enough to develop and deploy a basic cloud-native application. Developer advanced focuses on using the SDLC to iteratively develop, deliver, operate, secure, and manage applications. As a team executes the key agile ceremonies using the [Garage Method](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/cloud/), it's important for developers and architects to understand what is involved in moving software components consistently and reliably from *dev* to *test* and on to *production*.\n\nThese learning tasks are more advanced than those from the developer intermediate experience, so take your time and do some research on the topic before jumping into the task.\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Over the Web\">\n\n## Before the Workshop\n\nPlease complete these tasks before attending the first session.
