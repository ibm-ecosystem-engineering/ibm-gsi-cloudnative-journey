Anyone who wants to apply any of the assets can be a user. We encourage consumers to participate as evangelists and contributors as well.\n\n### Evangelists\n\n_Evangelists_ are members of the community who help others become consumers of the assets. They do so by:\n- Advertising the assets and encouraging others to use them\n- Supporting new consumers and answering questions, such as on Slack (IBM internal)\n- Reporting bugs or missing features through GitHub issues\n\n### Contributors\n\n_Contributors_ are members of the community who help maintain, improve, and expand the assets. In addition to using and evangelizing the assets, they make the assets better by:\n- Resolving issues in GitHub to fix bugs, add features, and improve documentation\n- Submitting changes as GitHub pull requests\n\n### Maintainers\n\n_Project maintainers_ (aka maintainers) are owners of the project who are committed to the success of the assets in that project. Each project has a team of maintainers, and each team has a lead. In addition to their participation as contributors, maintainers have privileges to:\n- Label, close, and manage GitHub issues\n- Close and merge GitHub pull requests\n- Nominate and vote on new maintainers\n\n## Types of teams\n\n### Core team\n\nCore team members are IBM employees responsible for the leadership and strategic direction of the set of Catalyst projects as a whole. The core team also directs how the Catalyst strategy will evolve with IBM Cloud product decisions. Core team responsibilities include:\n\n- Actively engaging with the projects' communities\n- Setting overall direction and vision\n- Setting priorities and release schedule\n- Focusing on broad, cross-cutting concerns\n- Spinning up or shutting down project teams\n\nThe core team will operate the technical steering committee.\n\n## Governance\n\n### Support\n\nHave questions? Found a bug? Learn where to go and what to do by visiting the [Support page](/help/support).\n\n## Contributing\n\n### Requirements\n\nSet up your SSH Key GitHub account and install node.js 11 or higher.\n\n- [Generating SSH Keys - GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)\n- [`nvm` (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to use the\n  `Node 6`.\n\n\n### Make a pull request\n\n**Note:** Before you make a pull request,\n[search](https://github.com/ibm-gsi-ecosystem/ibm-gsi-cloudnative-journey/issues) the issues to see if a\nsimilar issue has already been submitted. If a similar issue has been submitted,\nassign yourself or ask to be assigned to the issue by posting a comment. If the\nissue does not exist, create a new issue.\n\nWhen you're at a good stopping place and you're ready for feedback from other\ncontributors and maintainers, **push your commits to your fork**:\n\n#### Commit message format\n\nEach commit message should clearly describe the changes that are being made. During the\ndevelopment process as many small changes are made, a single one-liner is sufficient for\nthe commit message.\n\nWith larger changes or when the changes in the branch are squashed into a single commit,\nthe following commit message format is preferred.\n\n_Writing commit messages_\n\n- [Close a commit via commit message](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)\n- `<type>` indicates the type of commit that’s being made. This can be: `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `refactor`.\n- `<scope>` the scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change or the thing(s) that changed.\n- `<subject>` the subject should be a short overview of the change.\n- `<body>` the body should be a detailed description of the change(s). This can be prose or a bulleted listing.\n- `<issue reference>` the issue reference should be a reference to the issue number under which this change is being \nmade. The issue reference should be in the format of `{git org}/{git repo}#{issue number}`\n\n\n_Commit message format:_\n    \n  ```bash\n     <BLANK LINE>\n     <body>\n     <BLANK LINE>\n     <issue reference>\n  ```\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ```\n\n#### Create a draft pull request when the branch is first pushed to the fork\n\nGitHub recently introduced `draft` pull requests that allow a pull request to be recorded but\nmarked as not yet ready for review. Git provides a url to open a pull request the first time a branch\nis first pushed to the remote, which gives an excellent and easy opportunity to create the draft.\n\n**Note**: Be sure to link the pull request with the issue\n\nCreating a draft pull request early has the following benefits:\n\n1. Clicking the link provided by Git sets up the source and target repos/branches for you so you don't\nneed to hunt around\n2. Having the draft pull request gives insight for everyone else where the work is being done\n\n#### Push changes to your fork frequently during development\n\nAs you are making changes, push them frequently to the fork. This ensures that your code is backed up\nsomewhere and allows everyone else to see what activity is happening. It also means that if you get\npulled into some other work, the latest version of your changes are available for others to possibly\npick up where you left off.\n\n#### Pull in the latest changes from master frequently and rebase your branch\n\nIt is good to make sure you are always working off of the latest code from the upstream. With the \nchanges in a separate branch, it is easy to bring in upstream changes with the following steps:\n\n1. Checkout master in the local clone\n\n  ```shell script\n  git checkout master\n  ```\n\n2. Pull in the changes from the `upstream` repository\n\n  ```shell script\n  git pull\n  ```\n\n3. Check out your branch\n\n  ```shell script\n  git checkout {branch}\n  ```\n\n4. Rebase your branch on master\n\n  ```shell script\n  git rebase master\n  ```\n\n5. Force push the changes\n\n  ```shell script\n  git push --force-with-lease\n  ```\n\n> **Is it a Breaking Change?**\n\n> We want to respect semver.
