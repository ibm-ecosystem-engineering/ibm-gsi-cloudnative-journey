You should have received a Welcome email that provides the details of the IBM Partner Sandbox you've been assigned to and pointing you to this welcome page. By participating in this Cloud Native Learning Journey, you have access to:\n- The crafted education journey Agenda\n- A RedHat OpenShift managed service cluster that has been pre-installed with the IBM Garage Cloud Native Toolkit and IBM Cloud Pak for Applications. \n - The development environment is pre-configured in a pay-as-you-go IBM Cloud account which you'll use to perform your learning tasks.\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n\n**Warning:** If you did not receive the Welcome email this will mean you may\n not have been given access to the IBM Cloud account.

IBM is not mixing personal email addresses with the business email that has been associated with your **Partner Sandbox**.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Sandbox\n\nThe Cloud Native Sandbox is designed to make it easier for you to develop and deploy cloud-native applications. It includes an OpenShift cluster, cloud services bound to the cluster, and open source developer tools installed in the cluster. This combination supports developing cloud-native microservices architecture applications and CI/CD continuous deployment of those applications. \n\nThe IBM Cloud Enterprise Sandbox has been configured exactly how IBM\n recommends\n setting up a multi-tennat development team on the IBM Cloud. \n\nEach development team can contain up to **200+** developers. Each team has\n been configured in [IAM](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam) with its own access\n  group with a corresponding resource group. Your resources for your team's\n   Sandbox environment have been created in that resource group. As a member of\n    your team's access group, you'll have access to the resources in your team's Developer Tools environment. You are restricted from creating new cloud resources or deleting existing ones.\n\nThe following diagram shows how access has been configured. Imagine you are the Green user: There will be a number of other users in your team accessing the same development cluster. You will all be sharing the same cloud resources. The Sandbox administrators will be monitoring the cluster to identify any issues early and resolve them.\n\n![Workshop Teams](/workshop-teams.png)\n\nYou will be given access to your team's GitHub organization will be expected to create all of your application source code into this organization. This is how real world development projects work. This enables you to collaborate with your fellow team members and prevents you from creating duplicate project names.\n\n## Validating your access the IBM Cloud\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note**: If you have issues with any of the following steps, please raise an issue on the Slack channel **#gsi-labs-external** [Slack Channel](https://gsicsi.slack.com/archives/CSRDJD5HA).
