The cluster then turns from a production state cluster into a cluster that is used for multi tenant development teams.\n\nThe following describes the requirements:\n\n- **Installation**: Install the CNCF Tools using Terraform this create a new <Globals name=\"env\" />\n- **Cluster**: A <Globals name=\"kube\" /> or <Globals name=\"ocp\" /> cluster that both hosts the tools and itself is a deployment target for application builds\n- **Software Delivery Lifecycle**: Deployment target environments that support the application development lifecycle: *dev*, *test*, and *staging*\n- **Backend services**: Cloud services commonly required by cloud-native applications for monitoring, security, and persistence\n- **CI/CD**: A prebuilt, ready-to-run continuous delivery pipeline incorporating best-of-breed open source software tools supporting `Jenkins`, `Tekton` for CI and `ArgoCD` for CD\n- **<Globals name=\"templates\" />**: Prebuilt code templates for common application components and tasks incorporating best practices that developers can add to their codebase as needed\n- **Dashboard**: Integration of the tools into the OpenShift dashboard, and a centralized developer dashboard to help developers use the environment's capabilities\n\nA core set of tools are sourced from the [IBM Cloud Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label%3Ahelm#software) that can be found in the <Globals name=\"ic\" />. This approach helps assemble these reliable open source development tools into an end-to-end developer experience that is fully integrated with <Globals name=\"ic\" />'s managed container orchestration services.\n\nThe tools can also be sourced from the [Operator Hub](https://operatorhub.io/) and the [Red Hat Marketplace](https://marketplace.redhat.com/en-us). The Operations team that owns the IasC can decide the best approach to install the tools either using **Helm3** or **Operators**.\n\nTypically a **Cloud System Admin** installs and sets up a new <Globals name=\"env\" />, providing a place for the developers to start developing the [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/inception/practice_minimum_viable_product). The objective is to reduce the time required for a team to configure and prepare their development environment. The key benefit is to make the end-to-end [CI/CD development lifecycle](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/deliver/practice_continuous_delivery/) consistent across each platform and make the out-of-the-box developer experience as simple as possible.\n\nThe installation is performed using [Terraform](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/terraform), driven by scripts with a [modular configuration](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-terraform-modules) so unneeded tools can be easily disabled or new tools added. The combination of tools selected are proven in the industry to deliver real value for modern cloud-native development.\n\n### Environment components\n\nAfter installation, the <Globals name=\"env\" /> consists of a set of CNCF tools installed into your nominated kubernetes cluster.\n\nThis diagram illustrates the <Globals name=\"env\" />:\n\n![Provisioned CNCF Tools](./images/cncf-tools-environment.png)\n\nThe diagram shows the components in the environment: the cluster, the deployment target environments, the cloud services, and the tools.\n\n#### Development cluster\n\nThe heart of the <Globals key=\"env\" /> is a cluster:\n\n- An [<Globals key=\"iks\" />](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/container-service)\nor [<Globals key=\"roks\" />](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/openshift) 3-node cluster\n- Cluster namespace that encapsulates the tooling installed in the cluster: *tools*\n- Cluster namespaces for deployment target environments: *dev*, *test*, and *staging*\n\nThe following IBM Cloud services are created and bound to the cluster:\n\n| Capability                | Service        |Description |\n| -----------------------   |:-------------- |------------|\n| Logging                   | [LogDNA Logging](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-getting-started)  | Manage app logging LogDNA  |\n| Monitoring                | [SysDig Monitoring](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Sysdig-getting-started) | Manage monitoring of apps with SysDig |\n| AppID                     | [AppID Application Authentication](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/appid?topic=appid-service-access-management) | Secure your apps, APIs and Kubernetes Ingress end points |\n| Cloudant                  | [Cloudant NoSQL Database](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/cloudant) | NoSQL Database commonly used for data persistence |\n| Cloud Object Storage      | [Cloud Object Storage Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started) | Storage service commonly used for binary content |\n| PostreSQL                 | [PostgreSQL](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/postgresql) (used by SonarQube) | SQL Database used for structure data persistence |\n\n#### Continuous delivery tools\n\nThe following best-of-breed open source software tools are installed in the cluster's *tools* namespace:\n\n| Capability                  | Tool                                         | Bitnami   |Description |\n| --------------------------- |:--------------                               | -------   |------------|\n| Continuous Integration      | [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins.io/)            |  Yes      | Jenkins is a common tool for Continuous Integration   |\n| Continuous Integration      | [Tekton CI](https://tekton.dev/)             |           | Tekton is an emerging tool for Continuous Integration with Kubernetes and OpenShift  |\n| Code Analysis               | [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)      |  Yes      | SonarQube can scan code and display the results in a dashboard |\n| Artifact and Helm Storage   | [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/open-source/)|  Yes      | Artifactory is an artifact storage and Helm chart repository  |\n| Continuous Deployment       | [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/)|           | ArgoCD support Continuous Delivery with GitOps |\n| Contract API Testing        | [Pact](https://docs.pact.io/)                |           | Pact enables API contract testing |\n| Code Ready Workspace        | [Eclipse CHE](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview)  |           | IDE for editing and managing code in a web browser |\n\n\nIf you want to find out more about IBM assets that help you get these common tools installed\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"6100b3f3ed9882dc6b3bcf8a9b7cee29","counter":998,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"DevSecOps Overview"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: DevSecOps Overview\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nAn Overview of what DevSecOps is, and how it can help you\n speed up Cloud-Native solution delivery\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nOne of the patterns emerging with development teams is the ability to use [CNCF Tools](https://landscape.cncf.io/) as part of a more open multicloud CI/CD strategy.
