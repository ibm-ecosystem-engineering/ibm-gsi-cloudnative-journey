The <Globals name=\"env\" /> uses Artifactory as an artifact repository manager, which it uses to host its Helm repository.\n\n## What is Artifactory\n\n[Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) is an artifact management repository.\n\nAn artifact repository manager hosts multiple binary repositories, like a database management system for artifacts. The binary repository compliments the source code repository: the code from an SCM is the input to the build process, whereas a binary repository stores the output of the build process, often called artifacts. The artifacts are often individual application components that can later be assembled into a full product.\n\nAn artifact repository manager is an integral part of a CI/CD solution, a companion to the pipeline. As the pipeline builds artifacts, they're stored in the repositories. When the pipeline later needs artifacts that have already been built, they're retrieved from the repositories. This enables a build to be broken into smaller stages with well-defined inputs and outputs and provides better tracking of each stage's results. Often a failed pipeline can restart in the middle using artifacts that were already built and stored.\n\nAn artifact repository often serves as the storage for a package manager, which assembles an application from artifacts. Here are some common package managers and their repositories:\n- [**Maven**](https://maven.apache.org): Builds Java artifacts (such as Jar, War, Ear, etc.) and projects stored in [Maven repositories](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html) such as [Maven Central](https://maven.apache.org/repository/index.html)\n- [**npm**](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/): Assembles programs from JavaScript packages stored in [npm-registries](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/registry) such as the [public npm registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-the-public-npm-registry)\n- [**PIP**](https://pypi.org/project/pip/): Installs Python packages from [index repositories](https://packaging.python.org/guides/hosting-your-own-index/) such as the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/)\n- [**Helm**](https://helm.sh): Deploys applications to Kubernetes using charts stored in [Helm repositories](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_repository/) such as the [Helm Hub](https://helm.sh/blog/intro-helm-hub/) catalog of repositories\n\nDocker is not a package manager, but its architecture includes an artifact repository:\n- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/): Stores images in [Docker registries](https://docs.docker.com/registry/) such as [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/)\n\nNote that you do not need a very large team to start reaping benefits from an artifact repository manager. The initial investment is not very large and the benefits are felt immediately.\n\n## Artifact management in the Pipeline\n\nThe <Globals name=\"env\" /> will eventually be extended to store a number of artifact types in Artifactory. Thus far, the CI and CD pipelines exchange two types of artifacts: Docker images and Helm charts. The CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration), [Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton), etc.) builds these artifacts and ArgoCD deploys them.
