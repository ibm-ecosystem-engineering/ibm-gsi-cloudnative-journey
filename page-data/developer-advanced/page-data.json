Developer intermediate focuses on being able to use the environment well enough to develop and deploy a basic cloud-native application. Developer advanced focuses on using the SDLC to iteratively develop, deliver, operate, secure, and manage applications. As a team executes the key agile ceremonies using the [Garage Method](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/cloud/), it's important for developers and architects to understand what is involved in moving software components consistently and reliably from *dev* to *test* and on to *production*. \n\nThese learning tasks are more advanced than those from the developer intermediate experience, so take your time and do some research on the topic before jumping into the task.\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Over the Web\">\n\n## Before the Workshop\n\nPlease complete these tasks before attending the first session. This will help you get started quickly with the practical exercises.\n\n| Task                            | Description         | Link        | Time    |\n| --------------------------------| ------------------  |:----------- |---------|\n| Welcome Message | Welcome to Cloud Native Workshop  | [Introduction](/getting-started/introduction) | 5 mins |\n| Prerequisites | Install the prerequisite tools  | [Setup Prerequisites](/getting-started/prereqs) | 10 mins |\n| Sandbox Access | Validate access to your Development Cluster |  [Validate](/getting-started/checksetup) | 10 min |\n| **Operator Overview** | Operators are a method of packaging, deploying, and managing a Kubernetes application |[Operator](/developer-advanced/operator/) | 15 min |\n| **Operator Labs** | Developing operator step by step |[Operator Labs](/developer-advanced/operator/lab) | 45 min |\n| **Enhancing Inventory App with managed services** | | | |\n| App ID | Secure the solution with App ID  | [App ID](/developer-advanced/inventory-appid/) | 15 mins |\n| Cloudant | Integrate Backend with Cloudant Database | [Cloudant](/developer-advanced/inventory-cloudant) | 15 mins |\n| **Continous Integration** | | | |\n| Overview of pipeline structure (Jenkins & Tekton) | | | |\n| Understanding ConfigMaps and Secrets | | | |\n| Customizing the Jenkins pipeline | | | |\n| Customizing the Tekton pipeline | | | |\n| **Continuous Delivery VSI's** | | | |\n| VPC Overview | | | |\n| Create VSI into a VPC | | | |\n| Deploy an App into a VSI using tekton | | | |\n| **Continous Delivery** | | | |\n| Continous Delivery | Overview | [CD](/developer-foundation/continuous-delivery) | 15 mins |\n| Gitops & ArgoCD | Overview | [Gitops](/developer-advanced/gitops) | 15 mins |\n| CD for Inventory App | Enhance Inventory App with CD | [CD for Inventory App](/developer-advanced/inventory-cd) | 30 mins |\n| **DevSecOps** | | | |\n| DevSecOps | DevSecOps Overview | [DevSecOps](developer-advanced/devsecops) | 15 mins |\n| Advanced Container Security | DevSecOps with Aqua CSP | [Container Security](developer-advanced/devsecops-aquasec-csp) | 20 mins |\n| Advanced Container Security | DevSecOps with Twistlock | [Container Security](developer-advanced/devsecops-twistlock) | 20 mins |\n| Add security to CI/CD | DevSecOps with Trivy | [Incorporate CI/CD](developer-advanced/devsecops-trivy) | 30 mins |\n| **Advanced Monitoring and Logging** | | | |\n| Monitoring | Advanced Monitoring with Sysdig | [Advanced Monitoring](/developer-advanced/monitoring/) | 30 mins |\n| Log Management | Advanced Log Management with LogDNA | [Advanced Log Management](/developer-advanced/log-management/) | 30 mins |\n| End to End Tracing with Jaeger | | | |\n| **Advanced Microservices Techniques** | | | |\n| Servimesh & KNative | | | |\n| Modify inventory application with service mesh | | | |\n| Kiali, jaeger | | | |\n| Events with Kafka | | | |\n| Contract testing | | | |\n| OpenAPI and Swagger Editor | | | |\n| **Advanced Application Modernization** | | | |\n| Collect Data from Legacy App | | | |\n| Analyze with TA | | | |\n| Modernize the app | | | |\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Self Paced\">\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"In Person\">\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\nOnce you have completed these tasks, you will have completed the learning requirements for both the intermediate and the advanced Experience.
