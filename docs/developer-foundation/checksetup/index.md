!!! note

    Follow these steps to check you can access your team's Developer Tools environment.

Log in and view the resources:

- Log in to the [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com).
- The IBM Cloud Sandbox registration welcome email will include your account information, team, GitHub organization, and resource group.
- In the IBM Cloud console, switch to the account specified in the email.
- Navigate to the *Resource List*.
- In the Group filter, select your team's resource group.
- Click on **Expand All** (top right) to show all its resources.
- Under Cluster, you should see the cluster named `workshop-ocp46-{team}` where `{team}` is the name of your team. Some clusters may have a different number if there is more than one of that type.

Explore the Red Hat OpenShift resources and set up the CLI:

- In the Tags filter, enter both `ocp` to see just the Red Hat OpenShift cluster and services.
![Resource List](../images/checksetup/devtoolsservices.png)
- Click on each cloud service instance name and check that you can open each one's dashboard.
- Click on the Red Hat OpenShift cluster names to open their dashboards.
- Switch to the **Access** tab.
- Follow the instructions to install the CLI, then access the cluster from the CLI and validate that you are successfully connected.
- Press the *OpenShift web console* button and verify that you can open the Red Hat OpenShift console.

Explore the IKS resources and set up the CLI:

- Return to the **Resource List**.
- Remove the `ocp` tags and add the `iks` tag.
- Repeat the same steps for your team's Kubernetes cluster and services.
