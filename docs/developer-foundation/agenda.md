Before you jump straight into Cloud-Native development using this crafted enablement journey, you must understand the related basic concepts, technologies used and methodologies applied for Cloud-Native development.

Developer Foundation is broken into three areas:

- [Principles of Cloud, Cloud-Native development & deployment](developer-foundation#concepts)
- [Basics of Containers, Kubernetes/Openshift](developer-foundation#technologies)
- [IBM Garage Method]("developer-foundation#method")
