## Kubernetes 

These activites give you a chance to walkthrough basic kubernetes tasks via Katacoda. Then give them a try yourself by solving some problems from scratch.

These tasks assume that you have:
 - Reviewed Kubernetes Concept pages.
 - Created a Mini-Kube cluster.
 - Created a Katacoda Account.
