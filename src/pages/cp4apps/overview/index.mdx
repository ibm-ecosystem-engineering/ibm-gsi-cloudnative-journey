# Overview to Cloud Pak for Applications

</PageDescription>


## Introduction
Enterprises employ cloud technologies to deliver innovation at scale and at lower cost. New services are often built natively on cloud, but can also come with risk of “vendor lock-in” and escalating cost. Existing applications can be rewritten, but rewriting thousands (if not tens of thousands) of applications from the ground up is both cost and time prohibitive, so taking steps to modernize existing applications can be an attractive approach with faster time to value. Both strategies -- building new cloud-native applications and modernizing existing applications to support cloud environments -- need to be done in an open, portable manner that helps clients improve time to value while avoiding lock-in. Containers and Kubernetes enable this by providing portability and consistency in development and operations, but developers and administrators are still required to continuously connect component layers and verify interoperabilty. In addition, collecting, integrating and analyzing data enables data engineers and scientists to help application developers infuse AI into applications; but the trick is to do this without adding complexity and cost. And, then, once applications are built and connected to data, IT operations need them to run in an environment that is high performing, scalable and reliable. Today, around 80 percent of existing enterprise workloads have not yet moved to the cloud due to these challenges and enterprises struggle with movement, connectivity and management across clouds

Cloud accelerates digital transformation

- Innovate  Faster : Deliver true business value and delight your customer 

- Transform Business : Refresh legacy  and employ the cloud to deliver a competitive advantage

- Optimize ROI : Increase operational efficiency and reduce cost

## What’s preventing rapid Modernization today

Factors that probably provide hinderance for Application Transformation and Modernization are

- Skills : Microservices, containers/Kubernetes, open source, using Cloud based services

- “What code changes need to be made?” : Effort to change, affinities with current execution environment

- Enterprise needs : Security, compliance, data movement, scaling, integration, management, analytics, “day 2 operations”  in a hybrid Cloud environment

## Accelerators for Teams

Cloud Pak for Applications Accelerators for Teams is designed to deliver integrated workflows for application architects, application developers, and operations teams, allowing them to focus more intently in their respective areas of expertise.

Accelerators for Teams workflows covers common scenarios for these different roles, such as architects defining base images and starter applications for developers, developers iterating through code changes from their favorite IDE without worrying about the setup of a Kubernetes cluster, and operation teams using pipelines that can continuously monitor code deliveries and deploy the finished applications to a running cluster.

The following sections outline the overall architecture of the system, its components, and explains the typical workflows for the different roles.

### Architecture

The Kabanero architecture supports the activity of application developers, application architects, and operations teams in continuously delivering applications to Kubernetes environments. The architecture also covers non-functional requirements, such as supporting the implementation of operational policies for application management and security.

![Kabareno Architecture](/images/cp4apps/overview/CP4KabArch.png)


### Application Stacks

A large portion of the Kabanero experience is centered around application stacks. An application stack is created by an application architect as a logical set of software components for developing and deploying applications. Although the application architect builds the stacks, all of the software components that comprise them should be agreed upon by operations, enterprise, and developer advocates. An application stack is realized as components (such as tools and container images) used at coding time by application developers. Application stack configuration is done via standard Kubernetes operator (CRD) configuration.

If necessary, an application stack can be customized to meet local requirements. For example, you might want to define specific maintenance levels of software components or expose particular ports for use by the applications that are based on the stack. Customizing an application stack provides a mechanism for controlling the precise development and runtime environment for an application. In a large organization, customization ensures that applications are developed and tested with a level of consistency that promotes quality and helps guarantee a seamless implementation in your production environment.

### Developer experience

For application developers, the Kabanero experience is realized as tools that allows a developer to continuously iterate over changes to source code and validate the changes, considerably reducing or even eliminating the amount of time spent setting up and dealing with infrastructures such as Docker containers and Kubernetes clusters. The current tools are offered as a combination of the following initial offerings:

- [Appsody](https://appsody.dev/): A Command-line interface with commands for creating, building, running, and deploying applications. Appsody also has extensions that are used by other portions of the architecture to reassemble the application as a container image and to deploy it to a running container, and those will be covered in the respective sections of this overview.

- [Codewind](https://www.eclipse.org/codewind/): Hosted IDE (Codewind for Eclipse Che) and IDE extensions (Eclipse and Visual Studio Code) with a set of commands for creating, building, running, and profiling applications. When compared to Appsody, Codewind cannot deploy an application directly to a Kubernetes cluster, but it adds useful profiling capabilities where developers can inspect the usage of system resources between different local iterations on the source code.

Both Appsody and the local IDE extensions of Codewind depend on a running docker daemon to run a container with the resulting image for the application being developed.

### Architect Experience

The solution architect can codify technology standards and company policies using the Management Experience. The architech defines Stacks providing an efficient way for application developers to use them.

A stack is designed, built, and published by an application architect, which can then be pulled into local registries by application developers and into the deployment pipeline upon code deliveries.

![Architect Experience](/images/cp4apps/overview/arch-overview-stacks.png)



A stack has conventions for its internal structure, with a clear separation between the portions of the stack that are common across all applications created with the stack and the portions that are unique to each application, being visible and editable by application developers.

Those conventions for a stack are detailed in the [Stack Structure](https://appsody.dev/docs/stacks/stack-structure) section of the [Appsody website](https://appsody.dev/). For the portion of the stack that is common across all applications, an application architect makes choices such as the base container image, the runtime framework for the programming language being targeted by the stack, the toolset for the runtime framework, the management choices for the running application, and many other choices not directly related to the functional aspects of the application.

## Benefits

Cloud-native technologies & toolkits can help your organization pursue the goals of increasing productivity, accelerating time to market, delivering superior experiences, and gaining operational efficiency.

### Increase developer productivity

Give your developers the resources and environments that they need to innovate and deliver applications faster on-premises or in the cloud. Use containers, cloud resources, and automation without compromising security and compliance. Cloud-native continuous integration (CI) tools speed the software development process, reducing the cost of delays. Your organizations can go from waiting weeks for new build pipelines to instantiating them in minutes. You can scale when you need it and pay only for what you use.

### Accelerate time to market

In a digital world, businesses need to move quickly to increase customer acquisition and retention. By building and deploying cloud-native loosely coupled applications, IT can make quick updates and enhancements. Faster updates and enhancements mean that your business can deliver products and services at a faster pace.

### Deliver superior experiences

Cloud-native technologies provide resiliency and auto-scaling through microservices and container orchestration. You can deploy, update, scale, and restart cloud-native applications without impacting the system or users. Enterprises and service providers can deliver superior customer experiences with a high availability.

As software becomes key to how people engage with businesses and how businesses innovate to stay competitive, the speed of your application development and delivery is imperative.

### Gain operational efficiency

Businesses are running at a faster pace, but often struggle to respond quickly enough to changing market conditions. Cloud-native applications help your business operate with efficiency through automation, self-service, telemetry, and analytics that scale as needed.

DevOps is a set of practices that automate the processes between development and IT operations teams. The concept is founded on building a culture of collaboration between development and operations teams that historically functioned in relative silos. The benefits of DevOps include increased trust and faster software releases, and the ability to quickly solve critical issues and better manage unplanned work.
