Prisma Cloud Compute Edition (Twistlock)

</PageDescription>

## Guide

Prisma™ Cloud is a cloud security posture management (CSPM) and cloud workload protection platform (CWPP) that provides comprehensive visibility and threat detection across your organization’s hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure. 

For securing your host, container, and functions across the application lifecycle , Prisma Cloud is available as:

* Prisma Cloud Compute Edition, which is is the downloadable, self-hosted software that you can use to protect hosts, containers, and serverless functions running in any cloud, including on-premises and even fully air-gapped environments. You must deploy and operate the Console and Defenders in your own environment. 

* Prisma Cloud Compute, which is the SaaS version of the full Cloud Native Security Platform that delivers host, container, and serverless capabilities along with the cloud security posture management capabilities. Palo Alto Networks operates the Console for you, and you must deploy the agents (Defenders) into your environment to secure hosts, containers, and serverless functions running in any cloud, including on-premises. 


## Version
On IBM Managed Openshift 4.3 , the installation of Prisma Cloud Compute Edition 20.4 was carried out as part of this study.

## Architecture :
Prisma Cloud consists of a central management interface, called Console, security agents called Defender, a threat intelligence service, and ancillary tools and plugins.

* Console is Prisma Cloud’s management interface. It lets you define policy and monitor your environment. Console is delivered as a container image.
* Defender protects your environment according to the policies set in Console. There are a number of Defender types, each designed to protect a specific resource type.
* The Prisma Cloud Intelligence Stream is a real-time threat feed delivered from the Prisma Cloud content delivery network (CDN) to our customers' installations. This service gathers, analyzes, and prepares threat data for distribution to the Console located on your network. Console pulls data down from the Threat Intelligence Stream using HTTPS requests. The Intelligence Stream is Console’s only required external dependency.
 
* The twistcli tool is a command-line control and configuration tool. It ships with your Prisma Cloud release and can be found in the Prisma Cloud release tarball. Support is provided for both Linux and MacOs.
The twistcli tool provides a number of functions:

    * Scanning images for vulnerabilities and compliance issues. This is useful when you’re building custom tooling, or when you’re using a CI tool for which Prisma Cloud does not provide a native plugin.
    * Deploying (installing and uninstalling) Console and Defender across all environments.
    Downloading the latest threat data from the Intelligence Stream for transfer to an air-gapped environment.
   *  Packaging log files and other relevant data from your environment and optionally uploading that data so that Prisma Cloud Support can help debug issues.

## Installation on IBM Cloud Managed Openshift v4.3 :
Prisma Cloud software consists of two components: Console and Defender. 

Install Prisma Cloud in two steps. First, install Console. Then install Defender.

* Prisma Cloud Console is deployed as a ReplicationController, which ensures it’s always running. Prisma Cloud Defenders are deployed as a DaemonSet, which ensures that an instance of Defender runs on every node in the cluster. You can run Defenders on OpenShift master and infrastructure nodes using node selectors.

* OpenShift, offer DaemonSets, which guarantee that an agent runs on every node in the cluster. Prisma Cloud Defender, therefore, is deployed in Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters as a DaemonSet.


# Installation Guide for Prisma Cloud Compute(Twistlock) on IBM Managed Openshift Cluster 4.3 

Prisma Cloud Console is deployed as a ReplicationController, which ensures it’s always running. Prisma Cloud Defenders are deployed as a DaemonSet, which ensures that an instance of Defender runs on every node in the cluster. You can run Defenders on OpenShift master and infrastructure nodes using node selectors.

### 1.Login into Openshift cluster v4.3 
Login in as an OpenShift with your token so you can run the oc adm commands:
```
oc login --token=<token> --server=https://c100-e.us-east.containers.cloud.ibm.com:30223
```

### 2.	Create Twistlock Project
The commands below will create a new OpenShift project (twistlock) which will house all the Twistlock components.  
```
oc new-project twistlock
```

### 3.	Determine the Service for your OpenShift internal registry
```
oc get svc -n openshift-image-registry 
```
Results:
```
NAME                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)     AGE
image-registry            ClusterIP   172.21.98.28   <none>        5000/TCP    16d
image-registry-operator   ClusterIP   None           <none>        60000/TCP   16d

### 13.	Generate the Deployment twistlock_console.yaml file

```
./osx/twistcli console export openshift --storage-class "ibmc-block-gold" --image-name "image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/twistlock/private:console_20_04_163" --service-type "ClusterIP"
```
Result
```
Saving output file to /Users/smith/Documents/Cloud Hybrid Squad /Devsecops/PrismaCompute/prisma_cloud_compute_edition_20_04_163/twistlock_console.yaml
```

### 14.	Deploy Console
```
oc create -f ./twistlock_console.yaml
```

Result:
```
configmap/twistlock-console created
service/twistlock-console created
serviceaccount/twistlock-console created
persistentvolumeclaim/twistlock-console created
securitycontextconstraints.security.openshift.io/twistlock-console created
deployment.apps/twistlock-console created
Error from server (AlreadyExists): error when creating "./twistlock_console.yaml": namespaces "twistlock" already exists
```

### 15.	Create an external route to Console

From the OpenShift web interface, go to the twistlock project.
* Go to Networking > Routes
* Select Create Route
* Enter a name for the route, such as twistlock-console
* Hostname = blank 
* Path = /
* Service = twistlock-console
* Target Port = 8083 → 8083
* Select the Security > Secure Route radio button.
* TLS Termination = Passthrough (if using 8083)
* Insecure Traffic = Redirect
* Click Create

![Twistlock Console Login](/images/Twistlock-Login.png "Twistlock Console Login")

and apply the License 

![Twistlock Console License](/images/Twistlock-License.png "Twistlock Console License")


### 17.	Configure the Console
```
oc get svc -n twistlock
```
Result:
```
NAME                TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
twistlock-console   ClusterIP   172.21.186.161   <none>        8084/TCP,8083/TCP   18h
```

* Go to Manage > Defenders > Names
* Click Add SAN and enter Console’s service name.
* Click Add SAN and enter Console’s cluster IP.

 Any name in the table is added to Console’s certificate and becomes available as a configuration parameter in the Defender deployment pages.

 After Prisma Cloud is set up with these values, you will see them in the drop down menu in all of the Defender deployment pages as a configuration parameter. When you set up a new Defender, select how it should connect to Console from the same list of names in the Subject Alternative Names table.

## CI/ CD leveraging Jenkins :
Prisma Cloud integrates security into your continuous integration workflows so you can find and fix problems before they ever make it into production. Prisma Cloud’s CI tools let developers see vulnerability status every time they run a build, without having to run a separate tool or use a different interface. Security teams can set policies that act as quality control gates to ensure only remediated images progress down the pipeline.

### Jenkins Configuration for PRISMA (Twistlock)

Prisma Cloud provides a Jenkins plugin that lets you incorporate vulnerability scanning into your continuous integration pipeline

1.	Build and scan flow
After Jenkins builds a container image, the Prisma Cloud plugin scans it for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.

Prisma Cloud can pass or fail a build, depending on the types of vulnerability and compliance issues discovered, and the policies you set up in Console. By incorporating scanning into the build phase of the development workflow, engineers get immediate feedback about what needs to be fixed. The scan report provides all the information required to fix the vulnerabilities.

The sequence of events is described below:
1.	An engineer commits a change for a container under development. The commit triggers a build.
2.	Jenkins builds the container image.
3.	As part of the build process, Jenkins calls the Prisma Cloud plugin. The plugin collects data about the image, including the packages and binaries in the image, and submits it to Console for analysis.
4.	Console returns a list of vulnerabilities and compliance issues.
5.	The Prisma Cloud plugin passes or fails the build depending upon your configuration and policy.
6.	The results are displayed in the following places:
o	In Jenkins, within the project/job page, or relevant dashboard view.
o	In Prisma Cloud Console, on the Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Jenkins Jobs page.

The Jenkins plugin is built for Jenkins on Linux. 
To scan images with Jenkins on other operating systems, use a platform-specific twistcli binary.
