Migrate a Java EE app that requires no code changes

</PageDescription>

This exercise shows how to handle a "no code changes required" modernization of an existing traditional WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment (WebSphere ND) application to WebSphere Liberty running in a Docker container.

This exercise assumes the following:

1. You are using a <Globals name="env" /> that has already been installed.
1. Cloud Pak for Applications has already been installed in the environment.
1. You have Docker Desktop running on your laptop (one of the prerequisites).

This exercise consists of the following sections:

## Business need

This WebSphere Application Server customer finds itself in a common situation: They have a bunch of legacy monolithic applications running in WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment (WebSphere ND) on traditional IT. This was state-of-the-art back when the applications were first deployed, but the runtime requires periodic maintenance and constant administration. Now the customer would like to host the application in a cloud environment, but they have no desire to make any code changes to move the apps. While it might be beneficial for the customer to invest money in rethinking and redesigning their entire portfolio of applications to move off of traditional WebSphere, in reality this is overkill for applications that still provide the proper business functionality just fine. For these legacy monoliths, we can reduce the maintenance overhead by moving to WebSphere Liberty and running on Red Hat OpenShift. We can also reduce the administrative overhead by implementing a common CI/CD and SRE practices.

In this exercise, you will learn the skills to be able to demonstrate how *some* applications can be moved to Liberty in a Docker container without the need to make code changes. This approach known as [runtime modernization](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/architectures/runtime-modernization-solution/), which doesn't address the technical debt in the application but does remove the technical debt created by the WebSphere Application Server runtime. This approach can also be used to migrate applications running in other Java EE servers like Oracle WebLogic Server or Apache Tomcat. We will migrate the application using [IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/learn/ibm-transformation-advisor). This approach is one strategy for the overall modernization of a legacy Java application portfolio and an important skill to have.

### Project hill

Here's the [hill statement](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_hills/) describing the desired outcome of this migration:

- **Who**: Operations teams are tasked with moving existing Java applications from traditional WebSphere ND to "the Cloud" and don't have access to developers for the majority of the legacy Java portfolio.

- **What**: This is an application that users still need. They consider it good enough as-is: While bug fixes and new features might be desirable, the aren't worth the expense. Or step 1 for making the app more maintainable is moving it to the cloud where it'll be easier to improve it using modern development techniques like continuous deployment. The operations team needs to move to "the Cloud" and wants to standardize on Docker containers that they can run anywhere.

- **Wow**: With a few simple steps, you can move an application and the associated configuration to a Liberty runtime in a Docker container without changing code. This is something that can be repeated over and over on many apps in the portfolio in a factory type engagement.

## Architecture

PlantsByWebSphere is a simple legacy monolith that runs in WebSphere Application Server with a backend database (DB2). The diagram below shows a typical customer environment with IBM HTTP Server and WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment (WebSphere ND) running on traditional IT along with the application database.

  ![twasarch](/images/twas-arch.jpg)

The target for the runtime modernization is shown below with the containerized application running on Liberty on OpenShift Container Platform and the application database remaining on traditional IT.

  ![twasarch](/images/kube-arch.jpg)

For the purposes of this lab exercise, you will run a simulation of the WebSphere ND environment on your laptop using a Docker container that contains PlantsByWebSphere, WebSphere Application Server, and a data collector. You will then use IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor--part of the Cloud Pak for Applications installed in your team's <Globals name="env" />--to analyze the WebSphere ND environment and create the artifacts you need to run the same PlantsByWebSphere application on Liberty in a Docker container on your laptop.

  ![labarch](images/lab-arch.jpg)

## Technical Requirements

This modernization exercise has the following requirements:
- No code changes -- You don't even have access to source code
- The target is to get the application running on Liberty in a Open Shift Cluster on IBM Cloud 
- The IBM Cloud based DB2 Service is used for Database connectivity

## Guide
This exercise has the following steps:
- Run a pre-configured instance of traditional WebSphere in a Docker container on your laptop to simulate the existing customer environment
- Use the data collector in Transformation Advisor to scan the WebSphere runtime and the PlantsByWebSphere application
- Load the scan results in to Transformation Advisor running in the IBM Cloud environment's Red Hat OpenShift cluster
- Review the Transformation Advisor analysis
- Use the Open Shift S2I to build a Docker image with Liberty and deploy the application in the IBM Cloud Open Shift Cluster
- Access the newly created application on Container based Light weight Open Liberty 

### Scan the existing application

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Desktop/Laptop" open="true">  

-  Ensure your laptop has necessary previlages and open internet connectivity, to set up the local docker environment inorder to setup the local WAS and DB2 server for deploying the local application.

- You can then proceed on the below steps from scanning the location application using Data Collector tool of Transformation Advisore and further follow the steps to Analyze the Application and later deploy on the Open Shift cluster

</Tab>
<Tab label="Cloud Shell" open="true">

- The first part of the exercise until "Analyze the scan results" will be a demo. 

- The Scan results of the application and the application binaries are upload to the git and the same can be used for analysis the results using Transfromation advisor and later deploy them on the Open Shfit Cluster

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Note: If you do not have Docker running on your laptop/desktop, you will not be able to preform this step. Read through it,
but you will not be able to execute the steps until "Analyze the scan results"

We need to first have the application installed and running so that we can scan it.

#### Setup
In order to simulate a real traditional WebSphere ND customer environment on your laptop, we have provided you with a Dockerfile that creates a Docker image that you can run locally. This image will contain traditional WebSphere, the PlantsByWebSphere application, and the data collector in Transformation Advisor. The end result will be a container running the application which accesses the shared database.

<InlineNotification kind="info">

**Note:** In the real world, you would work with the client's WebSphere administrators to execute the data collector in their environment. For this exercise, we simulate that production environment as a Docker image running on your laptop.

</InlineNotification>


- Clone the repository to your machine

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/icp-dev-workshop.git
    cd icp-dev-workshop/lab4/CreatePreConfiguredtWASContainer
    ```

- Review the Dockerfile, see that the Docker image will contain:
    - The DB2 JDBC drivers
    - wsadmin scripts -- Used to configure the WebSphere application server for the PlantsByWebSphere application
    - Compiled application EAR files
    - The data collector in Transformation Advisor -- This was split in to 50mb chunks so it could easily be stored in GIT

- Review the `customCmd.properties` file

    This file is used to ensure that the data collector scans all of the files in the application. By default, the data collector ignores Java classes in the `com.ibm.websphere` packages, as well as packages that are typically used by open-source JARs such as `net` and `org` packages. These packages are ignored because they typically contain code that the client doesn't own, so any issues found by Transformation Advisor would be false positives. This becomes a problem when the client's code is in a package such as `net` or `org` because the scanner will ignore their Java code.

    ```java
    evaluation=--evaluate --excludePackages=com.informix,com.microsoft,com.sybase,com.sun,java,javax,net,org,oracle,sqlj,_ibmjsp --includePackages=com.ibm
    migration_liberty=--analyze --sourceAppServer=was855 --targetAppServer=liberty --targetCloud=dockerIBMCloud --includePackages=com.ibm --excludePackages=com.informix,com.microsoft,com.sybase,com.sun,java,javax,net,org,oracle,sqlj,_ibmjsp
    migration_was=--analyze --sourceAppServer=was855 --targetAppServer=was90 --targetCloud=vmIBMCloud --includePackages=com.ibm --excludePackages=com.informix,com.microsoft,com.sybase,com.sun,java,javax,net,org,oracle,sqlj,_ibmjsp
    #inventory=--inventory --excludeFiles=".*/directory/LargeXMLFileName.xml"
    #featureList=--featureList --excludeFiles=".*/directory/LargeXMLFileName.xml"
    #java_opt=-Xmx2g
    ```
- Review the `wsadmin.py` file
    - Ensure that the `serverName` and `port` for the DataSources match the values of your DB2 database (above).

- Build the Docker image

    ```bash
    docker build -t twas-plantsbywebsphere .
    ```

- Review the Docker image for traditional WebSphere Application Server

    ```bash
    $ docker images | grep websphere

    REPOSITORY                      TAG                         IMAGE ID        CREATED          SIZE
    ibmcom/websphere-traditional    profile                     67b52a4c08ad    12 months ago    1.75GB
    ibmcom/websphere-liberty        webProfile7-ubi-min-amd64   34544a83c068     3 weeks ago      446MB
    ```

    (The `websphere-liberty` image is shown here for comparison. You may not see it in your registry (yet).)

    You may be wondering: If traditional WebSphere runs in a Docker container, then why are we moving to Liberty?

    - One reason: **1.75GB**!! (The Liberty image is 446MB, one-quarter the size.)

    - Another reason: Having to hardcode configuration values in configuration files (like in the previous step) because traditional WebSphere can't read [configuration from environment variables](https://12factor.net/config)

- Start an instance of the Docker image

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 9080:9080 -p 9443:9443 -p 9060:9060 -p 9043:9043 -v "$(pwd)":/data --name twas-plantsbywebsphere twas-plantsbywebsphere:latest
    ```

- Tail the logs for the Docker container and wait for the message shown below:

    ```
    $ docker logs -f twas-plantsbywebsphere
    ...

    *** CERTIFICATES THAT ARE EXPIRED OR BEYOND THE EXPIRATION THRESHOLD AND HAVE BEEN REPLACED ***;

    CWPKI0645I: Personal certificate alias "default" in KeyStore "NodeDefaultKeyStore((cell):DefaultCell01:(node):DefaultNode01)" was REPLACED.
    CWPKI0645I: Personal certificate alias "default" in KeyStore "NodeRSATokenKeyStore((cell):DefaultCell01:(node):DefaultNode01)" was REPLACED.
    ```

    This message is expected because this version of the traditional WebSphere Docker image is over 12 months old and the SSL certificates have expired.

- Restart the container to refresh these SSL certificates

    ```bash
    docker stop twas-plantsbywebsphere
    docker start twas-plantsbywebsphere
    ```

- Tail the logs for the Docker container and wait for the message shown below:

    ```
    $ docker logs -f twas-plantsbywebsphere
    ...

    WSVR0001I: Server server1 open for e-business
    ```

- Log in to the Administrative Console

    https://localhost:9043/ibm/console

    NOTE: The console requires secure HTTP. Chrome and Safari block https://localhost and recently don't allow exceptions. You may need to use Firefox to log in to the console. Firefox blocks, but gives you the option to proceed anyways.

    username: `wsadmin` password: `passw0rd`

- Navigate to `Applications --> Application Types --> WebSphere enterprise applications` and verify that you see `HelloWorld` and `PlantsByWebsphere8`

    ![apps](images/twas-apps.jpg)

- Navigate to `Resources --> JDBC --> DataSources` and verify that you see `PlantsByWebSphereDataSource` and `PlantsByWebSphereDataSourceNONJTA`. These are the two DataSources that will be detected by the data collector.

    ![apps](images/twas-ds.jpg)

- Log out of the Administrative Console

- Access PlantsByWebSphere using http://localhost:9080/PlantsByWebSphere

    ![apps](images/twas-pbw.jpg)

#### Download Datacollector From Transformation Advisor
- Access the Transformation Advisor Page to Download the data collector. The TA access link can be referred as part of the Cloud Native Toolkit menu, in the open shift dashboard.


- Click on the "Add a new workspace (+) Button". The Enter the Name for the Workspace (Example: AppMod-{initials})

- Now Create a new Collection and provide a name for the collection and click on 'Save'. (Example: was-ta)

- The Datacollector / Upload data screen appears as shown

    ![apps](images/ta-dc.png)

- Now click on the Data collector Button to navigate to the Data collector User interface

    ![apps](images/ta-dc-download.png)

- Select the Operating system of the Application WAS Server Environment. Then Click download.

- Copy the installable zip to the Application WAS Server Environment.
    ```bash
    docker cp {downloaded tgz file name}.tgz twas-plantsbywebsphere:/demo
    ```



#### Run the data collector

Now that you have validated that the PlantsByWebSphere application is running in the Docker container, it is time to run the data collector.

- Enter the twas-plantsbywebsphere Docker container

    ```bash
    docker exec -it twas-plantsbywebsphere bash
    ```
- Extract the downloaded tgz file 
    ```bash
    tar xvfz {downloaded tgz file name}.tgz
    ```

- Navigate to the data collector directory

    ```bash
    cd /demo/transformationadvisor-2.0.3
    ```

- Execute the data collector

    ```bash
    ./bin/transformationadvisor -w /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer -p AppSrv01 wsadmin passw0rd
    ```

- When prompted, accept the License agreement

- After a few minutes, you will either see a "Thank you for uploading your data. You can proceed to the application UI for doing further analysis." message or an error related to "unable to upload the data" which will occur if the data collector can't access the Transformation Advisor UI which is running in Red Hat OpenShift.

    ![apps](images/ta-upload.jpg)

- Verify that the results zip file has been created

    ```bash
    $ ls -la AppSrv01.zip
    -rw-r--r-- 1 was was 340860 Nov 22 15:32 AppSrv01.zip
    ```

- Use CTRL+D to exit from the Docker container

- Copy the `AppSrv01.zip` file from within the Docker container to your local disk

    ```bash
    docker cp twas-plantsbywebsphere:/demo/transformationadvisor-2.0.1/AppSrv01.zip .
    ```

- Stop and remove the Docker container

    ```bash
    docker stop twas-plantsbywebsphere
    docker rm twas-plantsbywebsphere
    ```

### Analyze the scan results

<Tabs>
<Tab label="Desktop/Laptop" open="true">  

- You now have the Scan Results of the application for analyzing

- The Application Binary (plantsbywebsphere8.ear) is present in the below location. You will need this uploading to the transformation advisor
    ```binaries
    cd icp-dev-workshop/lab4/CreatePreConfiguredtWASContainer/lab4/binary/application
     ```

- The DB2 libararies are present in the below location. You will upload the "db2jcc.jar" in the Transformation advisor and later push the "db2jcc_license_cu.jar" to your git repository (one you will be creating during this phase for the migration bundle)

    ```binaries
    cd icp-dev-workshop/lab4/CreatePreConfiguredtWASContainer/lab4/binary/lib
    ```

</Tab>
<Tab label="Cloud Shell" open="true">

- Download the Scan results, reference application binaries and libaries from the below repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ibm-gsi-ecosystem/appmod-plants-app.git
    ```

-  Repository contains following artifacts. Scan results are included in the repository for convinience. If you are able to execute the previous steps on your Laptop/Desktop, you already have the scan results.
    - scan-results folder:  contains the "AppSrv01.zip" that will be used to analyze the Application using Transformation Advisor
    - application-binaries: Application Binary that will used for Migration/Transformation
    - db2-binaries: It has db2jcc.jar and db2jcc_license_cu.jar.  
        a) db2jcc.jar along with Application binaries will be used along with target files generated by Transformation Advisor as part of migration.
        b) db2jcc_license_cu.jar has to be separately uploaded to the repo that is created for migration in the coming below steps. This would be in newly created repo to the folder represented(src/main/liberty/lib/)


</Tab>
</Tabs>



In this section, you will upload the results from the data collector to the Transformation Advisor UI and analyze the findings.

- Access the Open Shift Cluster Dashboard to open the Transformation Advisor dashboard which as part of the Cloud Native Toolkit menu.


- Now that namespace and collection are created, access the Workspace (AppMod-{initials}) and the Collection.

- The Data collector / Upload data screen appears as shown

    ![apps](images/ta-dc.png)  


- Click `Upload data` and specify the `AppSrv01.zip` file you created from scanning the app

    After a few moments, the UI will display the Results page.

    ![apps](images/ta-upload-results.png)

#### Review the results

Take a moment to review the results. Transformation Advisor has determined this application is "simple" to move to Liberty on Private Cloud.

- What happens if you change the Preferred migration target to Liberty on Public Cloud? Why did the *complexity* change?

- Hold your mouse over the "Complex" box. Why does Transformation Advisor think you need a VPN?

- Click on the the `PlantsByWebSphere8.ear` and read the Public Cloud to Private Cloud Network Connection result.

Scroll down and note the External Dependencies that have been detected to be required by this application. Remember the DB2 database? Transformation Advisor detected that the application uses the database. It is telling you that either you will need to move the database to the public cloud or the application in the pubic cloud will need a network connection--probably a VPN--to the database in the private data center.

- Click the `<-- Recommendations` link at the top of the page to return to the Recommendations page, then set the Preferred migration target to Liberty on Private Cloud once again

#### Review the reports

Take a moment to review the reports. Make sure the Transformation Advisor UI is displaying the Results page and that the Preferred migration target is set to Liberty on Private Cloud.

- Click on the the `PlantsByWebSphere8.ear` again and review the Technology Issues section

- Scroll to the bottom of the page and review the Technology Report, Inventory Report, and Analysis Report

Note that at the top of each report, the command line parameters are shown. This helps to validate that your settings in `customCmd.properties` have been detected.

![pbw](images/ta-params.jpg)

Review each of the reports:

- **Technology Report**
    - Lists the Java EE features used by the application
    - Maps these features to the capabilities of the various WebSphere editions

    This is a useful first step to determining whether this application will run on Liberty.

    ![pbw](images/ta-tech.jpg)

- **Inventory Report**

    - Lists the Java EE components in the application

    This helps give an idea of the size of the monolith and identify the number of EJBs and web services.

    ![pbw](images/ta-inventory.jpg)

    - Shows the application structure

    This shows which JARs are included in the application, which helps identify technical debt such as old versions of Struts, Spring, and Hibernate, and whether the application packages IBM or JEE JARs that can cause classloading issues later.

    ![pbw](images/ta-inventory-tree.png)

    - Lists the Utility JAR files

    This shows which packages are in each JAR, which is especially useful if the client doesn't know which Java packages to scan. If you find this part of the report lists client code in packages that the scanner ignored such as `org` and `net`, you will need to update the `customCmd.properties` file to include these packages and re-run the scan.

    ![pbw](images/ta-inventory3.jpg)

- **Analysis Report**

    - Lists the issues found during the scan of the application

    Review the Severe and Warning results using the `show rule help` and `show results` links. Note that there are no severe result for this application and every item shown as warning. If there are Resuls related to severe (shown are red indicator), there would need some appropriate action to be performed prior deployment.

    ![pbw](images/ta-migration-analysis.png)
    
- Close the open report tabs and return to the Recommendations page

Let's go ahead and move this application to Liberty.


### Migrate to WebSphere Liberty

Transformation Advisor creates some accelerators to speed up the process of migrating an application. These files are a starting point for most modernization journeys and require modification. In this section, you will modify those files for PlantsByWebSphere.

- From the main recommendations page, click the `...` link on the right for the `PlantsByWebSphere8.ear` and select View migration plan

- You will Navigate to the Migration Bundle Page of the Transformation Advisor

![pbw](images/ta-migration-repo.png)

- Select the Build type as binary

- Ensure "Don't use" is selected for the "Use Accelerator for Teams Collection"

- Select Manual upload for "application Dependencies"

    - As per the application dependencies select the application binary and the db2 driver(db2jcc.jar) that we have downloaded earlier

- The migration files section show the below bundle

    ![pbw](images/ta-bindle.png)

    The migration plan shows the files that Transformation Advisor has generated:
    - **server.xml** - Transformation Advisor extracts most of the configuration from traditional WebSphere and generates a server.xml for Liberty to use
    - **Dockerfile** - Used to create the Docker image, which includes the application and configuration for Liberty
    - **Operator resources** - Used in Red Hat OpenShift to deploy the application using the [Open Liberty operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/open-liberty)
    - **pom.xml** - Used for Maven builds, particularly useful if the application does not already employ build scripts

- We will push the Transformation generated files along with the Application binary and Db2-jcc.jar file to the git repo. 

- To do previous step, 
    - First we will create a new repository in your public git hub. Let us name the repository as "ta-appmodern-migrate"

    - Copy the Https Url of your repository,
    'https://github.com/{username}/ta-appmodern-migrate.git'

   - Use this git repository in your Transformation Migration 
    
   - Once this is done, select the "send to git option" in the "Migration Bundle Page" to push the migration files to your git repository


- we need to edit the server.xml to change the database properties and the db2jcc_licence_cu.jar. so lets clone the git repo to the local system

    ```bash
    git clone 'https://github.com/{user}/ta-appmodern-migrate.git'
    ```


- Copy `db2jcc_licence_cu.jar` to the folder `src/main/liberty/binary/lib`  from you earlier download folder of the binaries.

Ideally, Transformation Advisor could figure out enough from the original application so that the generated files contain exactly what's needed and we could use these files as-is. Unfortunately, there are some details Transformation Advisor cannot discern, so we'll need to add those into the files manually.

- Edit the `server.xml` file using your favorite editor to make the following changes:

    - Change the `jpa-2.1` feature to `jpa-2.0`

    - Uncomment the `dataSources` and `jdbcDrivers`

    - In the dataSources, for the jdbcDriverRefs `DB2_Universal_JDBC_Driver_Provider` and `DB2_Universal_JDBC_Driver_Provider_(XA)`, change the DB2 driver locations to be `${shared.config.dir}/lib/global/db2jcc.jar` and `${shared.config.dir}/lib/global/db2jcc_license_cu.jar`. (THERE ARE TWO SETS OF FILE NAMES THAT MUST BE CHANGED)

    - In the `PlantsByWebSphereDataSourceNONJTA` datasource, in the `properties.db2.jcc` line, add `user="{to share}" password="{to share}" transactional="false"`

    - In the `PlantsByWebSphereDataSource` datasource, in the `properties.db2.jcc` line, add `user="{to share}" password="{to share}" transactional="true"` (Database user name and password)

    - Also to change the Database name and Host name

    - Validate the application tag to be <application id="PlantsByWebSphere8" location="plantsbywebsphere8.ear" name="PlantsByWebSphere8" type="ear"/>

    - Save your changes

The modified `server.xml` should look like this:

```

- Push the change to Git (server.xml and db2jcc_license_cu.jar)
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Changes related to DB -server.xml and db2jcc_license_cu.jar"
    git push
    ```


Now that we've configured Liberty and the application, let's deploy it on the Openshift.


### Run the application on Liberty

Now that we are ready for the application deployment on the Openshift cluster, we will here follow the S2I (Source to Image approach) for the build and deployment. Let us use the Cloud Shell for the same

- Login to your OC cluster using the Copy Login Command from the browser
    ```bash
    oc login {Cluster info}
    oc project dev-{initial} 
    oc project -q  
    ```

- Let us use openshift S2I to build and deploy

    ```bash
    oc new-app 'https://github.com/{repo}/ta-appmodern-migrate.git' --name=plantsbyliberty
    .....
    .....

    --> Success
        Build scheduled, use 'oc logs -f bc/plantsbyliberty' to track it progress
        Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by 
    executing one or more of the commands below:
          'oc expose svc/plantsbyliberty'
        Run 'oc status' to view your app
    ```



- Check the logs to track the build and deployment. This will take few minutes to deploy
    ```bash
    oc logs -f bc/plantsbyliberty
    ```

    Once the deployment is completed, create the service for the application

    ```bash
    oc expose svc/plantsbyliberty
    oc status
    ```

- If you need to redeploy the app after some changes, you can do this by manually triggering the below command
    ```bash
    oc start-build plantsbyliberty
    ```


- Now you can access the application by getting the hostname for the application by using get routes
    ```bash
    oc get routes | grep plantsbyliberty
    ```

  
- Test the app

    - Open browser to 'http://{host}/PlantsByWebSphere'

    - You will be able to landup in the home page of the applicatio

That's it. You now have this application running on Liberty in a Docker container which is sufficient for this exercise.

## Summary

You have now completed a simple Application Modernization exercises. This exercise demonstrated a simple runtime modernization scenario.
