## Business Need

In this guide, imagine you have completed an [Enterprise Design Thinking Workshop](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/enterprise-design-thinking/) and the result is an MVP statement that defines the desired business outcomes. Use the steps below to help deliver this MVP quickly while following [Garage Method best practices](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/cloud/).

### MVP Statement

An [MVP](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_minimum_viable_product/) is a [first hill](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_hills/). Here's the hill statement for the MVP we're going to build:

- **Who**: Distribution employees in each of the regional warehouses

- **What**: A secure web application that enables easy access to list of product [SKU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_keeping_unit) inventory levels and inventory locations

- **Wow**: Make the system appealing and easy to use. Deliver it hosted on the IBM Cloud platform. Develop it quickly as a [minimum viable product](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_minimum_viable_product/). Use the latest managed container runtimes and DevOps best practices to enable post MVP feature improvements. Simulate a release to a  _Test_ environment.

## Architecture

We will build the Micro App using a three-tier microservices architecture. Each tier encapsulates a clean separation of concerns. Each app component will be modelled using _microservices_ and use a number of [polyglot](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/polyglot-programming) programming languages and frameworks. Data will be stored in IBM Cloudant and the Micro App will be secured using IBM App ID.

### User interface

The Micro App's user interface will look like this [wireframe](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/practice_wireframes/):

![UI Design](/images/inventory-ui-design.png)

### Technical Requirements
The Micro App should adhere to the following technical requirements:

- Microservices
    - Stateless
    - REST APIs
    - Polyglot
- DevOps with CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery)
    - Monitoring and logging
    - Code analysis
    - App security
- Deployed to Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud or IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service
- Follow the [Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/) user experience

## Guide

You will approach creating the Micro App bottom up, meaning you will start by creating the backend microservice that manages integration with the data persistence and then build out the digital channel using a backend for frontend pattern. Finally, you will add a web UI to the solution.

### Prebuilt Solution

If you want to skip the guide and just get the components running, see [Deploy the Inventory App solution](#deploy-the-inventory-app-solution).


## Deploy the Inventory App solution

If you were unable to get everything working, you can deploy the Inventory App solution. 


### Inventory Services

- Create a new project from the [Inventory Management Service solution template](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/inventory-management-svc-solution/generate)
named `inventory-management-svc-{initials}`

- Clone the repository to your local machine

- Log into the cluster from the command-line then [register the pipeline](/developer-intermediate/deploy-app#8.-register-the-app-in-a-devops-pipeline)
    
    ```
    oc pipeline -n dev-{your initials}
    ```
   - replacing `{your initials}` with your actual initials

- Run `oc credentials` to get the credentials for the Jenkins instance.

- Open the [pipeline to see it running](/developer-intermediate/deploy-app#9.-view-your-application-pipeline)

### Inventory BFF

- Create a new project from the [Inventory Management BFF solution template](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/inventory-management-bff-solution/generate)
named `inventory-management-bff-{initials}`

- Clone the repository to your local machine

- Log into the cluster from the command-line then [register the pipeline](/developer-intermediate/deploy-app#8.-register-the-app-in-a-devops-pipeline)
    
    ```
    oc pipeline -n dev-{your initials}
    ```
   - replacing `{your initials}` with your actual initials

- Run `oc credentials` to get the credentials for the Jenkins instance.

- Open the [pipeline to see it running](/developer-intermediate/deploy-app#9.-view-your-application-pipeline)

- Get the backend service name this value by executing the command `oc get svc -n dev-{initials}.
    ```
    $ oc get svc -n dev-ar    
    NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
    inventory-bff-ar   ClusterIP   172.21.180.68   <none>        80/TCP    14m
    inventory-svc-ar   ClusterIP   172.21.4.95     <none>        80/TCP    20m
    ```

- Update the `connectsTo` value in `charts/base/values.yaml` to point to the kubernetes
service of the microservice: `connectsTo: inventory-svc-ar`


- Commit and push the changes
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update the connectsTo"
    git push
    ```

### Inventory UI

- Create a new project from the [Inventory Management UI solution template](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/inventory-management-ui-solution/generate)
named `inventory-management-ui-{initials}`

- Clone the repository to your local machine

- Log into the cluster from the command-line then [register the pipeline](/developer-intermediate/deploy-app#8.-register-the-app-in-a-devops-pipeline)
    ```
    oc pipeline -n dev-{your initials}
    ```

   - replacing `{your initials}` with your actual initials

- Open the [pipeline to see it running](/developer-intermediate/deploy-app#9.-view-your-application-pipeline)

- Get the bff service name this value by executing the command `oc get svc -n dev-{initials}.
    ```
    $ oc get svc -n dev-ar    
    NAME               TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
    inventory-bff-ar   ClusterIP   172.21.180.68   <none>        80/TCP    14m
    inventory-svc-ar   ClusterIP   172.21.4.95     <none>        80/TCP    20m
    ```

- Update the `connectsTo` value in `charts/base/values.yaml` to point to the kubernetes
service of the microservice: `connectsTo: inventory-bff-ar`

- Commit and push the changes
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update the connectTo"
    git push
    ```

- Verify that the application is running
