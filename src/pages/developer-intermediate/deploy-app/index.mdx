Create a sample application and deploy it with a CI pipeline

</PageDescription>

## Overview

The <Globals name="env" /> supports end-to-end development and deployment of an application. The instructions below
will show you how to do it.

You can create a new app using one of the [<Globals name="templates" />](/resources/codepatterns-overview). These have been
created to include all the key components, configuration, and frameworks to get you started on creating the code you
need for your solutions. The approach for getting started is exactly the same for an environment based on
**Kubernetes** or **Red Hat OpenShift**.

**Note:** The instructions provided below lean heavily on the use of the <Globals name="igccli"/> to both show how the
CLI works in context and to streamline the process (the reason for creating the CLI in the first place). However, the
use of the CLI is in no way required to use the <Globals name="shortName"/>.If you would prefer to work through these
instructions without the use of the CLI, we have provided the equivalent manual steps for each command on
the [Cloud Native Toolkit CLI](/getting-started/cli) page.

This video demonstrates how to work through the steps to create an application and use a deployment pipeline to install
it into your development cluster.

### 1. Log into your Development Cluster from the command line

- Make sure you have installed all the [Prerequisite Dev Tools](/getting-started/devenvsetup) before continuing
- Log in to the development cluster's CLI (Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift)

    To do so, navigate to your cluster in the _IBM Cloud console_, click on the **Access** tab, and follow the
    instructions  in **After your cluster provisions, gain access**  section to log in to the cluster from the command line

- You can test that you're connected to the cluster with the following simple command:

  ```shell script
  oc get pods -n tools
  ```

    <InlineNotification kind="info">

    **NOTE**: In case, your workshop is on Code Ready Workspaces,follow the steps in [Code Ready Workspaces Setup](/getting-started/crwsetup) before logging in to the cluster.

    </InlineNotification>

### 2. Create the development namespace

- Before getting started, the development namespace/project needs to be created and prepared for the DevOps pipelines.
- This is something that would typically happen once at the beginning of a project as a development team is formed and assigned to the cluster.

    ```
    oc sync {DEV_NAMESPACE} --dev
    ```

### 3. Open the Developer Dashboard

The Developer Dashboard makes it easy for you to navigate to the tools, including a
section that allows you to select a set of preconfigured [<Globals name="templates" />](/resources/codepatterns-overview) that make seeding your development project very easy.

- If you are logged into the OpenShift console you can select the tools menu and select **Developer Dashboard**

- If you are on a laptop/desktop Open a browser and make sure you are logged into [Github](https://github.com)

### 4. Create your app in Git

- From the Developer Dashboard, click on **<Globals name="templates" />** tab

    <InlineNotification kind="warning">

    **Warning:** If you are developing on a shared education cluster, you need to make it easy to identify
    your app. Please suffix the app name with your initials `{app name}-{your initials}` (e.g.
    `stockbffnode-mjp`) and use the **Git Organization** for the shared environment.

    **Warning:** Your browser needs to be logged in to your GitHub account for a template to work. If the link from the
    tile displays the GitHub 404 page, log in and reload the page.

    </InlineNotification>

- Pick one of the templates that is a good architectural fit for your application and the language and framework that you prefer to work with. For your first application select the **Typescript Microservice**. This works well in the Cloud Shell as well.

  Click on a <Globals name="template" /> **Tile** to create your app github repository from the
    template repository selected. You can also click on the **Git Icon** to browse the source template
    repository and click on the **Template** to create the template

- Complete the [GitHub create repository from template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
process.

  **Owner**: Select a valid GitHub organization that you are authorized to create repositories within or the one you were given for the shared cluster (See warning above)

  **Repository name**: Enter a valid name for you repo, GitHub will help with showing a green tick if it is valid (See warning above)

  **Description**: Describe your app

  Press **Create repository from template**

  ![Template](/images/template.png)

- The new repository will be created in your selected organization.

### 5. Clone your code

- Next, clone it to your local machine.
- Click on **Clone or download**
- Copy the clone _HTTPS link_, and use the `git clone` command to clone it to your terminal.
    ```shell script
    git clone https://github.com/gsi-ecosystem-demo/stockbffnode-mjp.git
    ```
- You will be required to enter your **GitHub User ID** and use your **Git Hub Personal Access Token** as your password. This will complete the clone of your git repository.

- Change into the cloned directory
    ```shell script
    cd stockbffnode
    ```
- You must rename the app to match your git repo or to a unique name for your solution. Then applications move into a _test_ environment they need to unique names.
- Edit `package.json` and edit the `name:` field and change it from its template name to your chosen name.
- Save the edits
- Push the changes back to your repository
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Update application name"
    git push
    ```
- You will be required to enter your **GitHub User ID** and use your **Git Hub Personal Access Token** as your password. This will push your changes back to the repository.

## Running the Application

### 6. Run the application

Most developers like to run the code natively in local development environment. To do so, follow the instructions listed in the **README.md** file to run the code locally.

- For the inside the folder for the code cloned from GitHub, run the following command to install the Node.js dependencies.
    ```
    npm install
    ```
- Then you can run the app from inside your cloud shell.
    ```
    npm run start
    ```

<Tabs>

<Tab label="Desktop/Laptop">
- Open a browser to `http://localhost:3000/api-docs/`
</Tab>
<Tab label="Cloud Ready Workspaces">

![CRW Open Link](./images/crwopenlink.png)

</Tab>

</Tabs>

- You can try out the sample API that is provided with this **Code Pattern**

- You can now add new features and function from inside the Cloud Shell and experiment with your code before you push you changes back to git.


### 7. Set the namespace context

Before running these remainder of the instructions commands it is important to set the
namespace/project context. (**Notes:** The `kubernetes` command will work for both `openshift`
and `kubernetes`.)

<Tabs>
<Tab label="OpenShift">

```shell script
oc project {DEV_NAMESPACE}
```
</Tab>
<Tab label="Kubernetes">

```shell script
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace={DEV_NAMESPACE}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### 8. Register the App in a DevOps Pipeline

Up to this point you have the code in a GitHub repository and have cloned it to you local development environment. You now need to register the repository with the continuous integration pipeline. The <Globals name="env" /> supports both [Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton) and [Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration) for continuous
integration.

- Start the process to create a pipeline

    ```shell script
    oc pipeline
    ```

    <InlineNotification kind="info">

    The pipeline command give an option for both `Jenkins` and `Tekton`. For more information about working with the
    different build engines, please see [Continuous Integration with Jenkins Guide](/guides/continuous-integration) and
    [Continuous Integration with Tekton Guide](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton)

    </InlineNotification>

- For the deployment of your first app with OpenShift select **Tekton** as the chosen CI engine.

- The first time a pipeline is registered in the namespace, the CLI will ask for a username and
**Personal Access Token** for the Git repository that will be stored in a secret named `git-credentials`. It will
also ask for the branch that should be used for the pipeline.

  **Username**: Enter your GitHub user id

  **Personal Access Token**: Paste your GitHub personal access token

  **Branch**: Press enter for the default git branch or type in another branch you want to register

- When registering a `Tekton` pipeline, you will be prompted to select which pipeline you want to use for your application. If you selected Node based Code Pattern select the Node pipeline. If you selected Java select the Gradle pipeline.
- For the first app select the `igc-nodejs-v1.x.0` version of the pipeline. This will use the Node based CI pipeline with Tekton.
    ```
    ? Select the Pipeline to use in the PipelineRun: (Use arrow keys)❯
     igc-appmod-liberty-v1-2-0
     igc-java-gradle-v1-2-0
     igc-java-maven-v1-2-0
     igc-nodejs-v1-2-0
     Skip PipelineRun creation
    ```

- When registering a `Jenkins` pipeline, the CLI will also set up a webhook with the git host

    **Note:** if the webhook registration step fails it is likely because the Git credentials are incorrect or do not have enough permission in the repository

- The pipeline will be registered in your development cluster.

### 9. View your application pipeline

The steps to view your registered pipeline will vary based on type of pipeline (`Jenkins` or `Tekton`) and container
platform version (`IKS`, `OCP 3.11`, or `OCP 4.3`).

<Tabs>
<Tab label="OpenShift 4.3 Tekon">

- Open the OpenShift Web Console from the Developer Cluster instance

    ![OpenShift](images/openshiftconsole.png)

- From menu on the left switch to the **Developer** mode

- Select _dev_ project that was used for the application pipeline registration

- In the left menu, select *Pipelines*

- You will see your application dev ops pipeline now starting to build and once completed will look like the image below.

    ![OpenShift](images/tektonpipeline.png)

</Tab>

<Tab label="OpenShift 4.3 Jenkins">

1. Open the OpenShift Web Console from the Developer Cluster instance

    ![OpenShift](images/openshiftconsole.png)

2. From the left-hand menu, select `Builds` -> `Build Configs`

3. Select your project from the drop-down menu at the top

4. The registered pipeline should appear in the list

</Tab>
<Tab label="Kubernetes Jenkins ">

1. Run the command `oc dashboard` in your terminal to open your Developer Dashboard.
2. Select the Jenkins tool to open the Jenkins dashboard
3. Run the command `oc credentials` in your terminal to get the list of logins for the tools
4. Use the Jenkins userid and password to log into the Jenkins dashboard

Wait for the pipeline stages to start building. Once the stages have completed, you will see a view similar to the one below.

![Jenkins Pipeline](images/pipeline.png)

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### 10. Access the running app

Once the pipeline has completed successfully, the app will be deployed into the namespace used when
registering the pipeline. To validate the app is running follow these steps:

**Note:** Be sure the namespace context is set correctly before running the following commands -
[set the namespace context](#7.-set-the-namespace-context)

- Retrieve the app ingress endpoint using commands below in your terminal.

    ```bash
    oc endpoints
    ```

- From the endpoints listed, select the URL for the repo that was just deployed and press **Enter** to
open that URL in a web browser and validate the application is working as expected

### 11. Locate the app in the web console

The build pipeline is configured to build the source code from the Git repository into a container image. This
image is stored in the [Image Registry](/guides/image-registry). After that the image is deployed into the
same namespace/project within development cluster where the pipeline ran and validated for its health. The steps
below will walk through locating the installed application within the Web Console.

<Tabs>
<Tab label="OpenShift 4.3">

- Open the **OpenShift web console**
- Change to the **Developer** view
