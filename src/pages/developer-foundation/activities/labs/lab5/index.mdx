## Problem

The Hyper Drive isn't working and we need to find out why. Let's debug the `hyper-drive` deployment so that we can reach light speed again.

Here are some tips to help you solve the Hyper Drive:

- Check the description of the `deployment`.
- Get and save the logs of one of the broken `pods`.
- Are the correct `ports` assigned.
- Make sure your `labels` and `selectors` are correct.
- Check to see if the `Probes` are correctly working.
- To fix the deployment, save then modify the yaml file for redeployment.

Reset the environment:
```
minikube delete
minikube start
```

Setup the environment:
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/learning-cloudnative-101/master/lab-setup/lab-5-debug-k8s-setup.yaml
```

## Validate

Once you get the Hyper Drive working again. Verify it by checking the endpoints.

```
kubectl get ep hyper-drive
```
