title: Kubernetes Lab 6 - Rolling Updates
---

## Problem

Your company's developers have just finished developing a new version of their jedi-themed mobile game. They are ready to update the backend services that are running in your Kubernetes cluster. There is a deployment in the cluster managing the replicas for this application. The deployment is called `jedi-deployment`. You have been asked to update the image for the container named `jedi-ws` in this deployment template to a new version, `bitnamy/nginx:1.18.1`.

After you have updated the image using a rolling update, check on the status of the update to make sure it is working. If it is not working, perform a rollback to the previous state.

Setup environment
