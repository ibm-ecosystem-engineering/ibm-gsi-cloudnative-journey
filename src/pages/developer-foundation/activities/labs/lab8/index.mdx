title: Kubernetes Lab 8 - Services
---

## Problem

We have a `jedi-deployment` and `yoda-deployment` that need to communicate with others.  The `jedi` needs to talk to the world(outside the cluster), while `yoda` only needs to talk to jedi council(others in the cluster).

## Your Task

- Examine the two deployments, and create two services that meet the following criteria:

**jedi-svc**
 - The service name is `jedi-svc`.
 - The service exposes the pod replicas managed by the deployment named `jedi-deployment`.
 - The service listens on port `80` and its targetPort matches the port exposed by the pods.
 - The service type is `NodePort`.

**yoda-svc**
 - The service name is `yoda-svc`.
 - The service exposes the pod replicas managed by the deployment named `yoda-deployment`.
 - The service listens on port `80` and its targetPort matches the port exposed by the pods.
 - The service type is `ClusterIP`.

### Setup environment:
```
kubectl apply -f https://gist.githubusercontent.com/csantanapr/87df4292e94441617707dae5de488cf4/raw/cb515f7bae77a3f0e76fdc7f6aa0f4e89cc5fec7/lab-8-service-setup.yaml
```
