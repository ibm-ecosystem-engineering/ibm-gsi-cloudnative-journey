## Problem

- Write a pod definition named `yoda-service-pod.yml` Then create a pod in the cluster using this definition to make sure it works.

The specificationsof this pod are as follows:

 - Use the `bitnami/nginx` container image.
 - The container needs a containerPort of `80`.
 - Set the command to run as `nginx`
 - Pass in the `-g daemon off; -q` args to run nginx in quiet mode.
 - Create the pod in the `web` namespace.


## Verification

When you have completed this lab, use the following commands to validate your solution. The 'get pods' command will 

`kubectl get pods -n web`
`kubectl describe pod nginx -n web`
