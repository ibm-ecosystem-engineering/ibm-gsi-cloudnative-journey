## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn about how to use docker and how to run applications using docker.

## Prerequisites

- You need [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) installed on your environment. You can download it [here](https://www.java.com/download/). Please install the latest version which is Java Version 8. Make sure you set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. You can verify the version after installation using `java -version`.
- Create a [DockerHub account](https://hub.docker.com/). This account is needed to push images to docker registry. Also create a repository following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/).
- You need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) in your environment. Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) to install it on Mac and [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) to install it on Windows.

## Working with docker

Before proceeding, make sure docker is properly installed on your system. 

1. Please verify your Docker by looking up the version.

If it is installed, you will see a version number something similar to below.

```bash
Docker version 19.03.0-beta3, build c55e026
```

** Running a hello-world container **

Let us start with a `hello-world` container. 

2. run a `hello-world` container.

If it is successfully run, you will see something like below.

```bash
$ 
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
1b930d010525: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:41a65640635299bab090f783209c1e3a3f11934cf7756b09cb2f1e02147c6ed8
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
 https://hub.docker.com/

For more examples and ideas, visit:
 https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
```

Since, `hello-world` image is not existing locally, it is pulled from `library/hello-world`. But if it is already existing, docker will not pull it every time but rather use the existing one.

This image is pulled from https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world. Docker hub is a repository used to store docker images. Similarly, you can use your own registries to store images. For example, IBM Cloud provides you a container registry.

**Verifying the hello-world image**

3. Now verify if an image is existing in your system locally.

You will then see something like below.

```bash
$ 
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello-world         latest              fce289e99eb9        5 months ago        1.84kB
```

## Get the sample application

To get the sample application, you will need to clone it from github.

```bash
# Clone the sample app
git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/cloudnative_sample_app.git

# Go to the project's root folder
cd cloudnative_sample_app/
```

## Run the application on Docker

### Build the docker image

Let's take look at the docker file before building it.

```
FROM maven:3.3-jdk-8 as builder

COPY . .
RUN mvn clean install

FROM openliberty/open-liberty:springBoot2-ubi-min as staging

COPY --chown=1001:0 --from=builder /target/cloudnativesampleapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /config/app.jar
RUN springBootUtility thin \
    --sourceAppPath=/config/app.jar \
    --targetThinAppPath=/config/dropins/spring/thinClinic.jar \
    --targetLibCachePath=/opt/ol/wlp/usr/shared/resources/lib.index.cache

```

- Using the `FROM` instruction, we provide the name and tag of an image that should be used as our base. This must always be the first instruction in the Dockerfile.
- Using `COPY` instruction, we copy new contents from the source filesystem to the container filesystem.
- `RUN` instruction executes the commands.

This Dockerfile leverages multi-stage builds, which lets you create multiple stages in your Dockerfile to do certain tasks.

In our case, we have two stages.

- The first one uses `maven:3.3-jdk-8` as its base image to download and build the project and its dependencies using Maven.
- The second stage uses `openliberty/open-liberty:springBoot2-ubi-min` as its base image to run the compiled code from the previous stage.

The advantage of using the multi-stage builds approach is that the resulting image only uses the base image of the last stage. Meaning that in our case, we will only end up with the `openliberty/open-liberty:springBoot2-ubi-min` as our base image, which is much tinier than having an image that has both Maven and the JRE.

By using the multi-stage builds approach when it makes sense to use it, you will end up with much lighter and easier to maintain images, which can save you space on your Docker Registry. Also, having tinier images usually means less resource consumption on your worker nodes, which can result cost-savings.


Once, you have the docker file ready, the next step is to build it. The `build` command allows you to build a docker image which you can later run as a container.

1. Build the docker file with the `image_name` of `greeting` and give it a `image_tag` of `v1.0.0` and build it using the current context.

You will see something like below:

``` bash
$ <command>

```

2. Next, verify your newly built image

The output will be as follows.

```bash
$ <command>
REPOSITORY                           TAG                   IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
greeting                             v1.0.0                89bd7032fdee        51 seconds ago      537MB

```

### Run the docker container

Now let's try running the docker container. Run it with the following parameters:

3. Expose port `9080`. Run it in the background in detached mode. Give the container the name of `greeting`.

Once done, you will have something like below.

```bash
$ <command>
bc2dc95a6bd1f51a226b291999da9031f4443096c1462cb3fead3df36613b753
```

Also, docker cannot create two containers with the same name. If you try to run the same container having the same name again, you will see something like below.

```bash
$ <command>
docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/greeting" is already in use by container "a74b91789b29af6e7be92b30d0e68eef852bfb24336a44ef1485bb58becbd664". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
See 'docker run --help'.
```

It is a good practice to name your containers. Naming helps you to discover your service easily.

4. List all the running containers.

You will see something like below.

```bash
$ <command>
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                              NAMES
bc2dc95a6bd1        greeting:v1.0.0     "/opt/ol/helpers/run…"   18 minutes ago      Up 18 minutes       0.0.0.0:9080->9080/tcp, 9443/tcp   greeting
```

5. Let's inspect the running container.

By inspecting the container, you can access detailed information about the container. By using this command, you get to know the details about network settings, volumes, configs, state etc.

If we consider our container, it is as follows. You can see lot of information about the `greeting` container.

```bash
$ <command>
[
    {
        "Id": "bc2dc95a6bd1f51a226b291999da9031f4443096c1462cb3fead3df36613b753",
        "Created": "2019-08-30T16:56:40.2081539Z",
        "Path": "/opt/ol/helpers/runtime/docker-server.sh",
        "Args": [
            "/opt/ol/wlp/bin/server",
            "run",
            "defaultServer"
        ],
        "State": {
            "Status": "running",
            "Running": true,
            "Paused": false,
            "Restarting": false,
            "OOMKilled": false,
            "Dead": false,
            "Pid": 27548,
            "ExitCode": 0,
            "Error": "",
            "StartedAt": "2019-08-30T16:56:41.0927889Z",
            "FinishedAt": "0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        },
        ..........
        ..........
        ..........
    }
]
```

6. Get the logs of the `greeting` container.

It helps you to access the logs of your container. It allows you to debug the container if it fails. It also lets you to know what is happening with your application.

At the end, you will see something like below.

```bash

```

This shows that the Spring Boot application is successfully started.

### Access the application

- To access the application, open the browser and access http://localhost:9080/greeting?name=John.

You will see something like below.

```bash
{"id":2,"content":"Welcome to Cloudnative bootcamp !!! Hello, John :)"}
```

**Container Image Registry**

Container Image Registry is a place where you can store the container images. They can be public or private registries. They can be hosted by third party as well. In this lab, we are using DockerHub.

### Pushing an image to a Registry

Let us now push the image to docker hub registry. Before pushing the image to the registry, one needs to login.

7. Login to Docker Hub using your credentials.

Once logged in we need to take the image for the registry.

8. Tag your image for the image registry. Using the `same name and tag from before`. (*NOTE: the command has both the source tag and repository destination tag in it.*)

9. Now push the image to the registry. This allows you to share images to a registry.

If everything goes fine, you will see something like below.

```bash
$ <command>
The push refers to repository [docker.io/<repository_name>/greeting]
2e4d09cd03a2: Pushed
d862b7819235: Pushed
a9212239031e: Pushed

```

Once the push is successful, your image will be residing in the registry.

### Clean Up

10. Stop the `greeting` container.

11. Remove the container.

12. Remove the image. (*NOTE: You will need the image_id to remove it.*)

### Pulling an image from the registry

Sometimes, you may need the images that are residing on your registry. Or you may want to use some public images out there. Then, we need to pull the image from the registry.

13. Pull the image `greeting` from the registry, 

If it successfully got pulled, we will see something like below.

```bash
ddcb5f219ce2: Pull complete
e3371bbd24a0: Pull complete
49d2efb3c01b: Pull complete

Status: Downloaded newer image for <repository_name>/greeting:v1.0.0
