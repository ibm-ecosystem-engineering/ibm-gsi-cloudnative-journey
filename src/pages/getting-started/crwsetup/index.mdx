### Introduction to Code Ready Workspace
CodeReady Workspaces is a developer workspace server and cloud IDE. Workspaces are defined as project 
code files and all of their dependencies necessary to edit, build, run, and debug them. Each workspace 
has its own private IDE hosted within it. The IDE is accessible through a browser. The browser downloads 
the IDE as a single-page web application. 
CodeReady Workspaces will enable a 100% developer experience to 
be delivered from a users browser.
 
 Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces provides:
 - Workspaces that include runtimes and IDEs 
 - RESTful workspace server 
 - A browser-based IDE 
 - Plugins for languages, framework, and tools 
 - An SDK for creating plugins and assemblies 

### CRW in Workshop
CodeReady Workspaces includes a powerful in-browser IDE with support for Microsoft Visual Studio Code 
extensions. As part of the workshop, we need only a machine capable of running a web browser through 
which CRW will provide an integrated environment to access the code repo, and the build environment to 
develop the code and then  test, and deploy on an OpenShift environment


### Setting up your Workspace on CRW

1. Login to the Openshift Cluster through the Web console, where the Code ready workspace is setup.

2. Access the Code Ready Workspace through the appropriate Code ready workspace URL that would have been shared.
**Note**:If the code ready workspace is configured through openshiftoAuth, You can access the above URL, once you have logged into the Openshift Cluster

3. If you are accessing it for the first time you need register as the registration page will be shown.  Ensure your user name should have strictly follow .(character allowed are 0-9, a-zand hypen in between), 
even if default values are displaced.Ensure you provide details regarding username, Email, First name and Last name (If SSO is not configured, you need to provide the password as well.
From the second time,you will be directly taken to workspace User Interface in step 4

4. Navigate to  the default Code Ready Workspace link  on your browser as shown in below picture.

6. Provide the workspace as part of the Name field.Click on "Remove" button in the Projects section to remove the project template. 
Basically, we are going to create an empty project.

7. Click on "Create and Open" button to create and load the workspace. Workspace will start loading. This may take a few minutes as the Container and plug-ins related to the stack has to be created and deployed.

8. Once the workspace is  created and loaded, you can see a vscode editor.

    export PATH=~/cloud-shell-commands:$PATH
    source ./cloud-shell-commands/install-igc
    ```
