With the release of **<Globals name="ocp" />** it is now even easier for
 developers to integrate the DevSecOps tools into the OpenShift console. The
  common DevSecOps tools are integrated into the OpenShift console. This enables
   easy access to all the common tools a developer needs.

### Tools configured with OpenShift Console

When the <Globals name="shortName" /> was configured for your development
 cluster. The administrator can now configure a set of short cut links to
  common tools you often use as a developer.

    ```
    igc dashboard
    ```

- This will open the Dashboard

### Access the tools URLs

- To list the ingress endpoints for all of the installed tools, use the [Developer Tools CLI](../getting-started/cli) to run the following command:

### Credentials

In the future, the tools in the Dashboard will be linked using a single sign-on (SSO) service.

    ```bash
    igc credentials
    ```
- The command lists the `userid` and `password` for each tool installed. You can use these credentials to log into each of the installed tools.
- More of the tools in <Globals name="ocp" /> will be integrated into the
 OpenShift console login process

### Developer Dashboard

The Developer Dashboard is one of the tools running in your <Globals name="env" />. It is designed to help you navigate to the installed tools and give you a simple way to perform common developer tasks, such as:
- **Dashboard**: Navigate to the tools installed in the cluster
- **Activation**: Links to education to help you learn cloud-native development and deployment using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud
- **<Globals name="templates" />**: Links to templates that will help accelerate your project
