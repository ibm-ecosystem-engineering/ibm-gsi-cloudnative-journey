## Create accounts

You will need the following accounts to use the **GSI Enterprise
 Sandbox environment**

- [GitHub account](http://github.com) (public, not enterprise): Create one if
 you do not have one aleady. If you have not logged in for a while, make sure
  your login is working. Make sure to add your enterprise email address as
   the primary address for the account. The **GSI Enterprise Sandbox** adminstrators will be inviting you based on your enterprise email address.

- [IBM Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com): Create one if needed, make sure you can log in. 

### Configure Github Primary Email address

- Setup primary email address to match your enterprise email. Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/changing-your-primary-email-address).

### Configure Github Personal Access Token
For your CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration), [Tekton](https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/ibm-garage-developer-guide/guides/continuous-integration-tekton)) to connect to and use your GitHub repo, it will need a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with `public_repo` and `write:repo_hook` scopes. The Personal Access Token only needs to be generated once because it is associated with the GitHub organization and can be used to access any of the organization's repos.

  - Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new token; name it something like "CI pipeline"
  - Select `public_repo` scope to enable git clone
  - Select `write:repo_hook` scope so the pipeline can create a web hook

  - The GitHub UI will never again let you see this token, so be sure to save
   the token in your password manager or somewhere safe that you can access later on
   
   Once you have created these accounts you can validate you can access your
    **GSI Enterprise Sandbox** cloud native development environment.
