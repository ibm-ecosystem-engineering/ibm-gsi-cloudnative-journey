## Create accounts

You'll need these accounts to use the Developer Tools environment.

- [GitHub account](http://github.com) (public, not enterprise): Create one if you do not have one aleady. If you have not logged in for a while, make sure your login is working. Make sure to add your enterprise email address as the primary address for the account.

- [IBM Cloud Account](https://cloud.ibm.com): Create one if needed, make sure you can log in. 

### Configure Github Primary Email address

- Setup primary email address to match your enterprise email. Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/changing-your-primary-email-address).

### Configure Github Personal Access Token
For your CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration), [Tekton](https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/ibm-garage-developer-guide/guides/continuous-integration-tekton), etc.) to connect to and use your GitHub repo, it will need a [GitHub personal access token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with `public_repo` and `write:repo_hook` scopes. The Personal Access Token only needs to be generated once because it is associated with the GitHub organization and can be used to access any of the organization's repos.

  - Navigate to [Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and generate a new token; name it something like "CI pipeline"
  - Select `public_repo` scope to enable git clone
  - Select `write:repo_hook` scope so the pipeline can create a web hook

  - The GitHub UI will never again let you see this token, so be sure to save the token in your password manager or somewhere safe that you can access later on

### If you are going to use yoru desktop/laptop for hands on exercises, follow the instructions in Desktop/Laptop tab
### If you cannot install tools on your desktop/laptop, follow the cloud instructions

## Install CLIs and tools

The following is a list of desktop tools required to help with installation and development.

- [Git Client](https://git-scm.com/): Needs to be installed in your development operating system, it comes as standard for Mac OS

- [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started): Required for management of IBM Cloud Account and management of your managed IBM Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift clusters
    - Don't install just the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-install-ibmcloud-cli), install the [IBM Cloud CLI and Developer Tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started#step1-install-idt)
    ```
    curl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash
    ```
    - Note: If you log in to the web UI using SSO, you'll need to [create an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-federated_id) for logging into the CLI. (You can also use this API key for [installing the Developer Tools environment](/admin/installation-ibm-cloud).)

- [OpenShift OC CLI](https://www.okd.io/download.html): Required for Red Hat OpenShift management and development
    - Place `oc` and `kubectl` in your Terminal `PATH`

    - #### MacOS/Linux
    - Once downloaded navigate to Download folder
    ```
    cd ~/Downloads/openshift-origin-client-tools-v3/
    ```
    - Then copy `oc` and `kubectl` to the system-wide available scripts folder (which is already in your PATH)
    ```
    cp kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
    cp oc /usr/local/bin/oc
    ```

    <InlineNotification >

     Depending on your MacOS security settings you may need to allow access to `oc` and `kubectl`, go to `System Preferences`=>`Security & Privacy` and press `Allow Anyway`*

    ```
    npm i -g @ibmgaragecloud/cloud-native-toolkit-cli
    ```

- [Tekton CLI](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli): Used to help control Tekton
 pipelines from the command line.
