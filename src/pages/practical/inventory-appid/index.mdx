Securing Inventory App with App ID

</PageDescription>

To secure the application we are using the capabilities available within the IBMCloud platform that use
a simple annotation on the ingress to enable integration with AppId. The <Globals name="templates" /> have already been
set up to use this feature and all that is required is update the configuration within the `values.yaml`
file of the helm chart.

### Inventory Management UI

- Find the app id binding secret by running the following command from a terminal where the kubernetes context has been set up (i.e. `oc login` has been done)
    ```bash
    kubectl get -n dev secrets | grep -E "binding.*appid"
    ```

- Update the `values.yaml` file in the Inventory Management UI chart to set `ingress.appId.enabled=true` and to 
    set the value for the AppId binding secret from the previous step
    ```yaml path=/chart/template-node-react/values.yaml
    ...

    ingress:
      enabled: true
      appid:
        enabled: true
        # web or app - https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/appid?topic=appid-kube-auth
        requestType: web
        binding:
          name: "{binding secret}"
          namespace: dev
        ...
    ```

### AppId redirect url config

- Get the ingress for the UI component by running `igc ingress -n dev-{initials}`.

- Open the IBM Cloud resource list - `https://cloud.ibm.com/resources`

- Open the AppId instance to the `Manage Authentication` -> `Authentication Settings` view

- Add the redirect url for the application to the web redirect URLs. The redirect url will have
the following form:

    `{ingress url}/appid_callback`
    
    e.g. `https://inventory-manangement-ui-dev.sms-test-oc-cluster.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/appid_callback`

### Add users to AppId

- Open the AppId instance to `Cloud Directory` -> `Users`

    ![AppId cloud directory users](images/appid-cloud-directory-users.png)

- Add yourself as a user with an email address, name, and password

### Access the UI

- Open a browser to the UI ingress

- You should be met with the AppId login screen. (This screen can be customized from the AppId service console but for now we are showing the default screen.)

- Provide the email address and password you configured in the previous steps. You should be granted access to the UI.
