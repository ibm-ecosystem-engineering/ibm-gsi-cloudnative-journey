## Inventory Management Part2 Application

Starting from [Configure the GitOps repo for Inventory Management service](#Configure-the-gitops-repo-for-inventory-management-service), all the following steps
need to be repeated for each application within the inventory application(svc,bff and ui components) for getting a end-to-end working solution:

1. [Using CD to deploy to Test](../inventory-cd)

2. [Securing Inventory App with App ID](../inventory-appid)

3. [Integrating the service to a cloud NoSQL database](../cloudantintegration)
