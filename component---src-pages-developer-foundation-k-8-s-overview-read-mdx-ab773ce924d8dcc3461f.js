When a liveness probe fails the container is restarted and, in some scenarios, a simple restart won’t fix the issue, which is where a readiness probe comes in.  A failed readiness probe won’t restart the container but will disconnect it from the traffic endpoint.  Removing a container from traffic allows it to get up and running smoothly before being tossed into service unready to handle requests from users.  Readiness probes give an application time to catch up and make itself ready again to handle more traffic versus shutting down completely and simply creating a new pod. In most cases, liveness and readiness probes are run together on the same application to make sure that the container has time to get up and running properly as well as stays healthy enough to handle the traffic."),Object(i.b)("h2",null,"Managed Lifecycle Pattern"),Object(i.b)("p",null,"The Managed Lifecycle pattern describes how containers need to adapt their lifecycles based on the events that are communicated from a managing platform such as Kubernetes.

This signal can be sent due to a failed liveness test or a failure inside the container.  SIGKILL allows the container to cleaning and properly shut itself down versus SIGKILL, which we will get to next. Once received, the application will shutdown as quickly as it can, allowing other processes to stop properly and cleaning up other files.

A SIGKILL is normally sent after the SIGTERM signal.  There is a default 30 second grace period between the time that SIGTERM is sent to the application and SIGKILL is sent.

If the postStart function errors out it will do so with a nonzero exit code and the container process will be killed by Kubernetes.
